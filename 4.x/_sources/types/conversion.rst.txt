Type Conversions
================
Rice converts fundamental types to their equivalent Ruby types. Fundamental types include nullptr, bool, numeric types (integer, float, double, complex) and char types.

Type conversion is easy to understand because its familiar to programmers. When you pass a boolean or integer into a method, you don't expect the method is going to change it - instead it just gets a copy.

Since they are copied, instances of fundamental types are disconnected. If a Ruby string is converted to a ``std::string`` then the two strings are independent and changes in one will *not* be reflected in the other.

Built In Conversions
--------------------
Rice supports all fundamental types out of the box. It also includes special handling for ``char*`` which is converted to a Ruby String. In addition, various STL classes are also converted as described in the STL :ref:`documentation STL :ref:`documentatio  <converted_stl>`.

Memory Management
-----------------
Because data is copied, it is up to each language to manage its own memory. For example, the following code would cause a memory leak:

.. code-block:: cpp

  char* leakMemory()
  {
    char* data = new char[BUFFER_SIZE];
    return data;
  }

  Class rb_cTest =
    define_class("Test")
    .define_function("leak_memory", &leakMemory);

.. code-block:: ruby

  test = Test.new
  data = test.data

The leak happens because Ruby does *not* take ownership of the ``char*`` and thus it is never freed. For more information refer to the :ref:`memory_management` section.
