.. _std_multimap:

std::multimap
=============
Ruby does not natively provide MultiMaps. Thus Rice wraps ``std::multimap``.

Rice will automatically define Ruby classes for each instantiation of ``std::multimap`` it finds. You may also manually define Ruby classes via the use of the ``define_multimap`` method. Multimap classes are added to the ``Std`` module.

Usage
^^^^^
For C++ methods that take multimap arguments, you can instantiate a new multimap from Ruby (see :ref:`stl_class_names`).

For example, assume this C++ code:

.. code-block:: cpp

  void passMultiMap(std::multimap<std::string, int> stringMultimap)
  {
  }

  define_global_function("pass_multimap", &passMultiMap);

One way to call it from Ruby is like this:

.. code-block:: ruby

  multimap = Std::Map≺string‚ int≻.new
  multimap["thrity seven"] = "thirty seven"
  pass_multimap(multimap)

In this case, Ruby is wrapping a C++ multimap. Therefore any changes made to the multimap in C++ will be visible to Ruby.

A second alternative is to pass it a Ruby hash instead:

.. code-block:: ruby

  hash = {"three" => 3, "five" => 5, "nine" => 9}
  pass_multimap(hash)

In this case, Rice will *copy* the Ruby hash instead of wrapping it. Thus any modifications made in C++ will not be visible to Ruby.

Ruby API
^^^^^^^^
Rice tries to make ``std::multimap`` look like a Ruby Hash by giving it an API that is a subset of ``Hash``. However, there are differences you need to keep in mind.

First, the following methods only work if the multimap type is copyable (copying is done in C++):

* multimap#copy(other)

Second, the following methods only work if the multimap type implements C++'s equal operator, ``operator==``:

* multimap#value?

Third, if the multimap type supports C++ streams, then the following method will work, otherwise it will return "Not Printable"

* multimap#to_s
