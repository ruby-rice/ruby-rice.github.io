.. _std_type_index:

std::type_index
===============
Introduced in C++11, ``std::type_index`` is a wrapper class around a ``std::type_info`` object, that can be used as index in associative and unordered associative containers.

Ruby does not have a concept of a type_index. Therefore, Rice wraps ``std::type_index`` which means that data is not copied between C++ and Ruby.

Ruby API
^^^^^^^^
The Ruby API for ``std::type_index`` is:

* TypeIndex#hash_code (see `hash_code <https://cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/type_index/hash_code.html>`_)
* TypeIndex#name (see `name <https://cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/type_index/name.html>`_)
